âœ… Project Outcome Summary
ðŸ“Œ Objective:
To predict if patients will miss appointments and provide data-driven recommendations to improve scheduling efficiency.

ðŸ”§ Tools Used
Python for modeling: Scikit-learn (Sklearn), Pandas

Power BI for visualization and trend analysis

ðŸ§ª Process & Key Findings
Data Preparation:

Cleaned and imported healthcare appointment data.

Created features such as gender, age groups, treatment types, day of the week, and SMS reminders.

Model Training:

A Decision Tree model was trained to classify whether a patient would show up or no-show based on historical data.

Factors like age, SMS reminder, and weekday were influential predictors.

Power BI Dashboard Insights:

Majority of no-shows were from the 60+ age group.

Thursday and Friday had a higher concentration of no-shows.

Patients who received SMS reminders were significantly more likely to attend appointments (75% attendance with reminders).

Gender and treatment types did not show strong correlation with attendance.

ðŸ“¦ Deliverables
Component	Description
Prediction Model	Decision Tree model classifying show/no-show outcomes
Power BI Dashboard	Visuals showing impact of age, reminders, weekday, and more
Optimization Suggestions	Targeted SMS campaigns for 60+ age group, limit appointments on Thursdays
